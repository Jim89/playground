## Professional profile

As a data scientist, I apply scientific rigour to identify and quantify business opportunities using data. I'm driven by my love of using data to find and communicate answers to business questions. My natural curiosity and tenacity helps me to quickly get to the heart of an issue. An ability to think critically and laterally enables me to see ways to solve problems and find an answer. Written and spoken communication skills let me empower others to understand and use the solutions I find. I love to dive into the data to seek answers, and I have the resourcefulness and flexibility to do so. I'm effective when working independently, and love working with a diverse team to reach a shared goal.

* Implemented analytics and data science in everyday business processes with lightweight solutions as well as software/application development.

* Wrote training for R, data visualisation (ggplot2), and reproducible analysis (RMarkdown, Git). Delivered to KPMG staff and students at the Imperial College Data Science Society. Guest speaker at the EARL Conference (Europe’s largest R conference). Increased the understanding and use of important data science topics and skills across the organisation.

* Developed probabilistic simulations for the UK lottery provider. Quantified the potential financial outcomes and addressed the client’s key questions addressed within two weeks. Facilitated important business and regulatory decisions.

* Analysed trade, market and communications data for an international investigation into manipulation of foreign exchange rates through inter-bank collusion. Implemented machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques for anomaly detection. Worked closely with interdisciplinary teams.

* Held individual responsibility for sections of work valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds, and delivered this work to an extremely high standard.

* Presented results to C-Suite executives. Contributed results to regulatory reports which were used as a basis for institutional financial penalties and individual prosecutions.
